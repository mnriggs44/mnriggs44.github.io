# About Me
## My Interests 
Somethings that I have most interest in is Reading and plants. My favorite type of book is crime but I have started r.ading more science fiction/fantasy recently. The series I am currently reading is the The Fourth wing. I also enjoy anything dealing with plants. Learning how to use plants to make tinctures or a cup of tea that doesnt have a ton of chemicals included.  It also gives me an oppourtunity to be outside and enjoy nature.  
## Websites I recommed
[Herbal Encyclopedia](https://cloverleaffarmherbs.com/)- I recommend this website due to the wealth of information you can get about plants
[Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/)-I recommend this website if you like reading.
